<p>Many domestic helpers are looking for a job in Canada to work there as a babysitter or live-in caregiver. In Canada the demand for caregivers and nannies is quite high as the provision of kindergarten, daycares and after-school daycares are limited, in both the private and the public sphere. In addition, newly-arriving Asian immigrants often opt to bring their helpers with them or they hire a new helper, being accustomed to the concept. On the other hand many domestic workers are dreaming to go to Canada for work. Canada is considered the land of promises by most Filipino helpers. And this is not just because of Canada’s green pastures, landscapes and natural beauty, but mostly because of their anticipation of what it will bring. </p>

<p>Most helpers in Canada are from the Philippines because those from other countries don’t meet the Canadian standards. Canada has made changes to the live-in caregiver program in 2014 and now requires overseas applicants to have signed a written contract with an employer, who has already been approved to hire a caregiver from overseas. In addition, helpers need to have at least six months’ training or at least one year of full-time paid caregiver experience in the past three years. The Canadian government also requires the domestic helper to have good knowledge of English and French, limiting the intake of Indonesian helpers. But most helpers from other countries than the Philippines are not eligible, because they do not meet the requirement of having successfully completed the equivalent of a Canadian secondary school education.</p>

<a id="higher-salary" class="anchor" href="#higher-salary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Higher salary</h3>

<p>First of all, as expected, the minimum salary for live-in caregivers is much higher than the wages they earn elsewhere. In Canada the minimum wage is 11 Canadian dollars per hour – roughly HK$10,000 or US$1300. To compare in most Arabic countries Filipino house maids have a minimum wage of US$400, which is already higher than housemaids of other nationalities. In Hong Kong the starting wage is about US$530 for all domestic workers. But there is more that attracts foreign helpers to apply to Canada. </p>

<h3>
<a id="working-hours" class="anchor" href="#working-hours" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working hours</h3>

<p>Secondly, much less known, Canada actually has a cap of working hours for its entire workforce. The legal working hours also apply to domestic workers. In Canada live-in caregivers may live at the same place as their employers, but that does not mean that they work whenever the employer requests them to. The caregiver can work a maximum of 8 hours per day at designated hours. This is in sharp contrast with Arabic and Asian countries where domestic helpers often work from the early morning hours till late at night. In addition, if the employer requires the helper to work longer than the 8-hour workday, the caregiver needs to agree in written and the employer needs to pay overtime. This makes it even more attractive to apply for a housekeeper job in Canada.</p>

<h3>
<a id="living-conditions" class="anchor" href="#living-conditions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Living conditions</h3>

<p>Canadian employers cannot require a caregiver to live in their home. This is also different from other countries like Hong Kong and Singapore where foreign domestic workers are required by local laws and regulations to live at the home of the employer. In Arabic countries employers often require the helper to live in because they are legally responsible in case she gets pregnant or violates local penal codes. Despite these local regulations many helpers prefer to live out in boarding houses, and do so even at the risk of being caught. The Canadian law provides nannies legally with the opportunity to live-out, but also protects domestic helpers if they don’t want to live outside in the sense that they can opt to live at their employers home for free. </p>

<p>Many domestic helpers rely on relatives who are already working in Canada to find a potential employer. Others use Facebook, but often the potential employers found on there are scammers. Employment agencies are also ready to “help” domestic helpers, charging them an arm and a leg for their services. Most of these agencies are not fair employment agencies, as they use backdoors to charge the helpers more. Finally, there is the website www.HelperChoice.com that does not charge domestic helpers any placement fee or commission and checks the employer ads to ensure that scammers are deleted immediately upon discovery.

<h3>
<a id="canadian-permanent-residency" class="anchor" href="#canadian-permanent-residency" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Canadian permanent residency</h3>

<p>A final, and perhaps the most attractive reason, often cited by housekeepers is that there is the possibility to become a Canadian permanent resident. Remember most foreign domestic workers go overseas to provide for their family and their children. Earning a higher salary for less worked hours, being paid for overtime and the imagination of being treated better, makes Canada the dream destination for Filipino domestic workers. The possibility of obtaining permanent residency and being able to bring one’s family over, make this dream taste even sweeter. </p>
